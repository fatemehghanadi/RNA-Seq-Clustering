# Clustering scRNA-seq Data: A Comparative Analysis

üß¨ This project tests different methods for clustering scRNA-seq data, including traditional algorithms (GMM, DBSCAN, KMeans, etc.) and swarm optimizers (PSO, GWO, ABC, FFA, BA). Performance is evaluated using Pbmc3k and NdpKO_R1 datasets with metrics like ARI, NMI, FMI, and execution time.

This project evaluates various clustering methods and swarm-based optimizers on scRNA-seq datasets to identify their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional biological data.

## Data Description üìä

The analysis uses two scRNA-seq datasets:
1. **Pbmc3k**: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
2. **NdpKO_R1**: Norrin-deficient (Ndp) knockout replicate 1.

### Preprocessing Steps
- **Filtering Genes/Cells**: Removed cells and genes based on predefined thresholds for expression levels.
- **Quality Control**: Eliminated cells with high mitochondrial gene expression (indicative of damage/stress).
- **Normalization**: Scaled data uniformly across cells.
- **Log Transformation**: Applied log transformation to reduce variability.
- **Feature Selection**: Identified highly variable genes.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Utilized PCA for feature space reduction.

## Methods üõ†Ô∏è

### Clustering Algorithms
- **GMM**: Gaussian Mixture Model assumes each cluster follows a Gaussian distribution, optimized using Expectation-Maximization.
- **DBSCAN**: Groups dense regions of points and labels sparse regions as noise.
- **HDBSCAN**: Builds a hierarchy of clusters, improving DBSCAN's flexibility and noise handling.
- **KMeans**: Partitions data into `k` clusters by minimizing within-cluster variances.
- **Agglomerative Clustering**: A hierarchical method that merges clusters iteratively based on proximity.
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**: Uses graph-based relationships between data points for dynamic clustering.

### Swarm-Based Optimizers
Integrated with GMM and KMeans for enhanced clustering:
- **PSO**: Models particles‚Äô movement in search space to optimize cluster centers.
- **GWO**: Mimics wolf pack behavior to explore and exploit solutions.
- **ABC**: Simulates bees‚Äô food search to optimize clustering.
- **FFA**: Inspired by fireflies‚Äô flashing behavior to guide clustering.
- **BA**: Leverages bats‚Äô echolocation for adaptive optimization.
