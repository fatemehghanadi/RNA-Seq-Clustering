# RNA-Seq-Clustering
This project tests different methods for clustering scRNA-seq data, including traditional algorithms (GMM, DBSCAN, KMeans, etc.) and swarm optimizers (PSO, GWO, ABC, FFA, BA). Performance is evaluated using Pbmc3k and NdpKO_R1 datasets with metrics like ARI, NMI, FMI, and execution time.
